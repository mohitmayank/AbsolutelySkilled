## What is this?

AbsolutelySkilled is a collection of skills that teach AI agents domain-specific knowledge - from framework APIs to marketing strategy. Each skill is a self-contained folder with structured markdown that agents load on demand.

Skills work with any agent that supports the SKILL.md format: Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenAI Codex, Cursor, and [40+ more agents](#supported-agents).

---

## Flagship Skills

These skills form the backbone of AbsolutelySkilled - install them first and watch your AI agent transform from a code assistant into an autonomous development partner.

### Auto Engineer - One Skill, Four Specializations

One unified skill for all engineering work - code, UI, docs, and repo maintenance. Auto-detects which specialization to activate from the prompt and loads only the relevant reference files, replacing what used to be several separate commands.

**Install:**

```bash
npx skills add AbsolutelySkilled/AbsolutelySkilled --skill auto-engineer
```

**Usage:**

```bash
/auto-engineer "Add OAuth2 login with Google and GitHub providers"
/auto-engineer "Redesign the dashboard to look less like AI slop"
/auto-engineer "Write a spec for the notifications system, don't build yet"
/auto-engineer "Run a security audit and fix the flaky CI tests"
```

**How it works:**

- **ENGINEER** - relentless design interview → reviewed spec → dependency-graphed task board → safe-wave TDD execution → generator-evaluator verification. Includes a SPEC-lite mode for design-doc-only handoffs.
- **UI** - design system knowledge with concrete values: spacing, color theory, typography, components, dark mode, accessibility.
- **DOCS** - Diátaxis-driven documentation: write, improve, or audit tutorials, how-tos, reference, and explanation pages.
- **MAINTAIN** - repo-wide health: security/CVE audit, lint/type debt paydown, flaky-test deflaking, dead-code pruning, dependency upgrades - five sub-modes sharing one detect-scan-triage-fix-verify engine.

Everything in ENGINEER mode is tracked on a persistent `.auto-engineer/board.md` that survives across sessions - resume where you left off, audit decisions, or hand off to another developer.

```
INTAKE --> SPEC --> DECOMPOSE --> EXECUTE --> VERIFY --> CONVERGE
```

### Second Brain - Persistent Memory for AI Agents

A structured, hierarchical knowledge store in `~/.memory/` that gives your AI agent persistent memory across projects, sessions, and tools - automatically loading only what's relevant to the current context.

**Install:**

```bash
npx skills add AbsolutelySkilled/AbsolutelySkilled --skill second-brain
```

**Usage:**

```bash
# Memories are loaded automatically at conversation start
# After complex tasks, your agent proposes what to remember

"Remember that we always use Bun instead of npm"
"What do you know about our auth system?"
"Update my memory about the deployment process"
```

**How it works:**

- **Tag-indexed retrieval** - memories are scored against your current context and only the top matches are loaded (no wasted tokens)
- **100-line ceiling** - files stay small and split automatically, keeping context window usage efficient
- **Wiki-linked graph** - memories cross-reference each other with `[[wiki-links]]` for rich knowledge traversal
- **Auto-propose learnings** - after complex tasks, your agent suggests what to remember for next time
- **CRUSP lifecycle** - Create, Read, Update, Split, Prune - your memory stays fresh and organized

### Skill Audit - Security Analysis for AI Agent Skills

A deep, context-aware security scanner for AI agent skills - combines a Python mechanical pre-scan with AI-powered semantic analysis across 6 threat categories to catch prompt injection, data exfiltration, supply chain attacks, and behavioral risks that regex tools miss.

**Install:**

```bash
npx skills add AbsolutelySkilled/AbsolutelySkilled --skill skill-audit
```

**Usage:**

```bash
/skill-audit skills/suspicious-tool
/skill-audit skills/suspicious-tool --json
/skill-audit skills/                          # Batch scan entire registry
```

**How it works:**

1. **Mechanical pre-scan** - `scripts/audit.py` handles deterministic checks: unicode smuggling, base64 payloads, frontmatter validation, file size limits, phantom dependencies, orphaned references
2. **Prompt injection analysis** - reads every instruction as an attacker would: direct overrides, persona hijacking, instruction laundering, conditional triggers, multi-step manipulation
3. **Permission and exfiltration audit** - flags destructive commands, credential access, webhook data theft, DNS exfiltration, covert channels
4. **Supply chain verification** - maintainer provenance, dependency confusion, typosquatting, suspicious URLs, scope creep detection
5. **Behavioral safety** (AI-only) - unbounded agent loops, user consent bypass, hallucination amplification, context pollution, trust transitivity
6. **Structured verdicts** - PASS / FAIL / REVIEW REQUIRED with severity-ranked findings table and per-finding recommendations

Output as a human-readable table report (default) or JSON for CI/tooling integration.

### Video Creator - End-to-End Programmatic Video Production

A 7-step orchestrator that takes you from "make me a video about X" to a finished 4K video - using Remotion, ElevenLabs TTS, royalty-free music, and SFX. No video editing knowledge required.

**Install:**

```bash
npx skills add AbsolutelySkilled/AbsolutelySkilled --skill video-creator
```

**Usage:**

```bash
/video-creator "Create a 60-second product demo for my SaaS dashboard"
/video-creator "Make an explainer video about how our API works"
/video-creator "Build a social clip announcing our new feature"
```

**How it works:**

1. **Deep interview** - up to 30 questions about your product, audience, tone, assets, and visual preferences
2. **Generate script** - structured YAML with scenes, timing, narration text, and audio cues
3. **Visual verification** - build minimal Remotion compositions, preview in browser, iterate on design
4. **Build full project** - complete Remotion compositions with all animations matching the approved script
5. **Add background audio + SFX** - source royalty-free music, place sound effects at trigger points
6. **Add narration** - ElevenLabs TTS with voice selection (deferred to save costs until visuals are approved)
7. **4K render** - final preview, user approval, render at 3840x2160

Companion skills: [remotion-video](skills/remotion-video/), [video-scriptwriting](skills/video-scriptwriting/), [video-audio-design](skills/video-audio-design/), [video-analyzer](skills/video-analyzer/)

### Supaguard - Synthetic Monitoring from Your Codebase

A production monitoring skill that reads your source code, generates Playwright monitoring scripts, and deploys them as recurring checks via the supaguard CLI - all without committing any test scripts to your repository.

**Install:**

```bash
npx skills add AbsolutelySkilled/AbsolutelySkilled --skill supaguard
```

**Usage:**

```bash
# Point at your app and the agent does the rest
"Set up monitoring for my Next.js app"
"Monitor the login flow on production"
"Create an uptime check for our checkout page"
```

**How it works:**

1. **Reads your source code** - scans components, routes, data-testids, API endpoints, and forms
2. **Identifies critical flows** - login, checkout, page load, dashboard access
3. **Generates Playwright scripts** - written to `/tmp/`, never committed to your repo
4. **Tests in the cloud** - runs the script via `supaguard checks test` before deploying
5. **Interactive deployment** - walks you through naming, scheduling, regions, and alerting one step at a time
6. **Multi-region monitoring** - US East, EU North, India Central with configurable cron schedules

Companion skills: [playwright-testing](skills/playwright-testing/), [cli-design](skills/cli-design/)

### Codedocs - AI-Agent-Friendly Codebase Documentation

Generates a structured `docs/` tree from your codebase that AI agents can navigate instantly - module docs, pattern docs, an overview map, and a file-to-doc index with 70%+ coverage enforcement.

**Install:**

```bash
npx skills add AbsolutelySkilled/AbsolutelySkilled --skill codedocs
```

**Usage:**

```bash
codedocs:generate                              # Generate docs for your entire repo
codedocs:generate --output documentation/      # Custom output directory
codedocs:generate packages/api                 # Specific subdirectory (monorepos)
codedocs:generate --exhaustive                 # Force exhaustive coverage
codedocs:ask "how does the auth flow work?"    # Answer from docs, not source
codedocs:status                                # Check coverage and find gaps
codedocs:update --scope src/auth/              # Update after a refactor
codedocs:update --diff HEAD~5..HEAD            # Update from recent commits
```

**How it works:**

- **OVERVIEW.md** - architecture, tech stack, entry points, and a module map that routes any question to the right doc
- **Module docs** - one per bounded context, covering public API, internal structure, dependencies, and implementation notes. Large modules (15+ files) are automatically split into sub-module docs
- **Pattern docs** - cross-cutting concerns like error handling, logging, auth, and testing strategy documented once instead of scattered across every module
- **INDEX.md** - a file-to-module lookup table so any agent can instantly answer "which doc covers this file?"
- **Coverage-first** - runs a recursive census of your repo, verifies 70%+ file coverage (scaled by repo size), and flags gaps before writing. A huge repo generates 30-80 doc files, not 8-12
